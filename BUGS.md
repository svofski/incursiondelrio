BUGS AND PROBLEMS
=================

5. FUEL double-channel sounds may sound out of sync

6. No plane explosion animation 

10. Needs at least some kind of title screen. Maybe text on the grass
before bridge.

11. Transitions that are not pretty should be hidden by palette

12. Collision of plane and terrain may register as collision with copter

13. Extra life and sound

Hopefully fixed:
================

1. Hitting a copter with wing may result in permadeath
  
The copter does not get destroyed, and apparently collision goes on forever.
Kaboom sound keeps sounding. This is very bad.

2. Dying immediately after start destroys the game

3. Dying after passing bridge 0 resets the game in a strange location. 
Bridge 0 may be there. Road may be not. It should reset the game to beginning.

4. An enemy does not get regenerated when the game is reset at a bridge if it
is located too close to the bridge.

8. No fuel low warning sound

9. No death by lack of fuel

7. There are too many interceptor jets coming all at once. Their density
should increase more gradually.
